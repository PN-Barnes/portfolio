                <p>I am a brand new full stack engineer located in the bay area of California. I learned my skills through the codeCademy Full Stack Engineer program and currently attending the California
                    Berkely Extension coding bootcamp. From this I hope to find a job as a fullstack engineer located within the Bay Area, however, I have always moved around during my life and I am open to moving to another location
                    for my career. I'm trained in HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, and currently learning python and plan to learn ios development later downt the road. Scroll down and check out the projects I have worked on in my coding portfolio.
                    See something you like? Head down to the contact section to get in touch with me so we can talk about coding and possible future projects.

            <p>This project was about me creating a random selecter within Javascript. How this operates is by first selecting a genre, then depending on that genre, it selects a band, and then from that band, it selects a song.</p>
